Time Tracker in Go
============

Simple cross-platform time tracker

Description
--------------

This project inspired by https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster. Hamster is more functional time tracker but it works on Linux only and requires GTK. My tracker is oriented to Mac OS X, and it can be compiled on Linux too.
